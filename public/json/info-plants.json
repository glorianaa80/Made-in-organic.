        "The process is simple and relatively fast. The seeds are planted and when approximately 7 days pass, it begins to germinate. For this reason, if you plant on consecutive dates, you can enjoy it throughout the winter.",
        "When the plant is 20 cm tall or already has 4 leaves, not counting the first two, it is time to transplant it. This should be done either directly to the ground, or to pots whose capacity is at least 25 liters. Of course, always in a soil that is abundant in organic matter and nitrogen.",
        "The col lection of the leaves will occur more or less after 3 months of having been transplanted, or at 4 after having been sown. It must be between the months of November to March, which is when it tastes better because it is colder. Even if you let it endure some frost, its flavor will improve a lot and it will be sweeter."
